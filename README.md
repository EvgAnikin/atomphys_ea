# atom-phys

## Features

- automatic fetching of energy levels and transitions from NIST
- optional pint integration for units
- scalar polarizability

## TODO

- more unit tests
  - physics based tests using alkali data
- cli gotrian diagram
- svg/matplotlib gotrian diagram
- more examples and documetnation
- import / export of custom set of levels and transitions, separate from NIST data. Many atoms and ions have a small set of lower levels and very precisely measured, and this is more relevant.
- other functions
  - vector and tensor polarizability
  - cross section
  - oscillator strength
  - matrix elements between sublevels
  - generate interaction matrix suitable for qutip
